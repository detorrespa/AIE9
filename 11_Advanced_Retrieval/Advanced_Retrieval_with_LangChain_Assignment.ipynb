    "- Understand and implement multiple retrieval strategies for RAG\n",
    "- Compare naive, BM25, multi-query, parent-document, contextual compression, ensemble, and semantic chunking approaches\n",
    "- Build RAG chains over a health and wellness knowledge base using LangChain and QDrant\n",

    "BM25 performs better in this case because “Bird Dog” is a specific and relatively uncommon technical term. An embeddings‑based model might associate it semantically with “birds” or “dogs,” thereby drifting toward zoological content that is irrelevant to the intended meaning. BM25, by contrast, relies on exact token matching, which allows it to retrieve directly the chunk where that precise term appears, without ambiguity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explain how generating multiple reformulations of a user query can improve recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall measures how many of the existing relevant documents we are able to retrieve. The challenge with relying on a single query is that the vector space is anisotropic: the same underlying information may be expressed using different vocabulary, and a single search vector only “illuminates” a specific region of that space.\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating 𝑁  reformulations (e.g., “exercises for lower‑back pain,” “how to relieve discomfort in the lower back,” “spinal rehabilitation routine”), each variant activates a different region of the embedding space. The union of all unique retrieved documents therefore covers a much broader semantic surface, recovering relevant chunks that no individual query would have reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade‑off is straightforward: higher recall, but at the cost of increased latency and LLM token usage (one additional call to generate the reformulations plus 𝑁 searches in the vector store). It may also introduce noise if the reformulations drift too far from the original intent."

    "\n",
    "A \"small-to-big\" strategy - the Parent Document Retriever works based on a simple strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We split the full document into large \"parent\" chunks (e.g. 2000 characters).\n",
    "2. Each parent chunk is further split into smaller \"child\" chunks (e.g. 400 characters).\n",
    "3. The child chunks are stored in a VectorStore, while the parent chunks are stored in an in-memory docstore.\n",
    "4. When we query our Retriever, we do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the child chunks.\n",

    "### ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive (e.g., FAQs), how might semantic chunking behave, and how would you adjust the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic chunking determines where to “cut” the text by computing the cosine distance between embeddings of consecutive sentences: when the semantic shift exceeds a predefined threshold, a new chunk boundary is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short and repetitive FAQs introduce two main issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 1 — Overly coarse chunks.  \n",
    "If each question uses similar phrasing (e.g., “How long…?”, “How often…?”, “How many times…?”), the cosine distances between adjacent sentences remain low and relatively uniform. The algorithm interprets this as a single coherent topic and merges everything into one large chunk, thereby losing the granularity required to retrieve individual answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 2 — Boundaries in the wrong places.  \n",
    "Conversely, if there is superficial lexical variation across otherwise similar questions (e.g., “headache” vs. “migraine”), the algorithm may place a boundary between a question and its own answer, splitting the Q&A pair into separate chunks. The result is that the retriever may return questions without their answers, or answers without their corresponding questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended adjustments:  \n",
    "Rather than relying solely on cosine‑distance thresholds, the most effective approach is to combine structural rules with semantic signals: treat each question–answer pair as an indivisible atomic unit (using explicit separators such as Q: / A:) before applying semantic chunking. This ensures that boundaries are never placed inside a Q&A pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, one can lower the sensitivity threshold so the algorithm becomes more aggressive in creating boundaries, accepting the presence of more, smaller chunks. This improves retrieval precision in FAQ contexts, where each pair represents an independent knowledge unit, and the loss of cohesion can be mitigated by using a Parent Document Retriever to regroup thematically related FAQs in the context returned to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, semantic chunking assumes a certain degree of semantic richness and variability in the text. For short, repetitive content, combining explicit document structure with semantic chunking consistently outperforms semantic chunking alone."
