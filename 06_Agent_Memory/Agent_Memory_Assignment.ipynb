    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building on our Personal Wellness Assistant use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified wellness agent\n",

    "\n",
    "What are the trade-offs between **short-term memory** (checkpointer) vs **long-term memory** (store)? When should wellness data move from short-term to long-term?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- What information should persist across sessions?\n",
    "- What are the privacy implications of each?\n",
    "- How would you decide what to promote from short-term to long-term?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Trade-offs Between Short-term and Long-term Memory Systems\n",
    "When working with AI systems that manage user information, it’s important to understand the trade-offs between short-term memory (often called the checkpointer) and long-term memory (the store). Both serve different purposes, and choosing when to use each one affects context, privacy, and system behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term Memory (Checkpointer)\n",
    "Short-term memory only exists within the current conversation thread. It updates automatically with every message, which makes it useful for maintaining conversational flow. Because it expires when the session ends, it carries lower long-term privacy risks. However, its size grows as the conversation continues, and it can include sensitive information if the user mentions it during the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term Memory (Store)\n",
    "Long-term memory persists across threads and even across sessions. Unlike the checkpointer, it is managed manually, meaning the system only stores what the user explicitly wants to keep. This memory is ideal for stable personal information, such as identity details or consistent preferences. Since it is persistent, it requires stronger privacy controls, including explicit consent, retention policies, encryption, and the ability to delete information in compliance with regulations like GDPR.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Move Information from Short-term to Long-term\n",
    "Promoting information to long-term memory makes sense when it is stable, important, or safety‑related. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Permanent identity details (name, age, chronic medical conditions)\n",
    "Explicit user preferences (“Always answer briefly”, “I’m vegetarian”)\n",
    "Safety‑critical information (allergies, injuries, contraindications)\n",
    "Any detail the user explicitly asks the system to remember (“Remember that I have diabetes”)\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy Considerations\n",
    "Short-term memory is temporary, which reduces long-term exposure but still may contain sensitive data during the session. Long-term memory, on the other hand, carries higher privacy risks because it persists. For that reason, it requires:\n",

    "## ❓ Question #2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use message trimming with a 128K context window when HealthWellnessGuide.txt is only ~16KB? What should **always** be preserved when trimming a wellness consultation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- The \"lost in the middle\" phenomenon\n",
    "- Cost and latency implications\n",
    "- What user information is critical for safety (allergies, conditions, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Why Should We Do Trimming Even When 128K Context Is Available?\n",
    "When working with large language models, it might seem like having a 128K‑token context window means we can just keep everything. But in practice, trimming the context is still important for several reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The “Lost in the Middle” Phenomenon\n",
    "LLMs tend to be less accurate with information placed in the middle of very long contexts.\n",
    "They pay more attention to the beginning and the end.\n",
    "Keeping the context shorter helps the model focus on the most important details.\n",
    "So even if we can load 128K tokens, it doesn’t mean the model will use them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cost and Latency\n",
    "Using 128K tokens is much more expensive than using 16K.\n",
    "In fact, 128K can cost around 8 times more.\n",
    "Processing time also increases almost linearly with context length.\n",
    "For long conversations, this becomes expensive and slow very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Relevance\n",
    "Most of the time, messages from 40 or 50 turns ago are no longer relevant to the current question.\n",
    "Keeping only the recent and meaningful context improves answer quality.\n",
    "Old or irrelevant information can confuse the model instead of helping it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Should ALWAYS Be Preserved?\n",
    "In a wellness‑related consultation, there are certain elements that should never be trimmed because they are essential for safety and correct reasoning.\n",
    "1. System Message\n",
    "The agent’s core instructions must always remain intact.\n",
    "2. Critical Safety Information\n",
    "This includes:\n",

      "Emma's Query: I'm feeling low on energy lately. What would you suggest?\n",

      "Agent Response:\n",
      "Hi Emma! I understand that feeling low on energy can be frustrating, especially when you're aiming to increase your energy levels. Here are some personalized suggestions to help you boost your energy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Nutrition**: Since you're following a vegan and gluten-free diet, focus on incorporating energy-boosting foods. Consider meals rich in complex carbohydrates, such as quinoa, sweet potatoes, and brown rice, along with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Foods like bananas, nuts, seeds, and legumes can also provide sustained energy. Make sure to stay hydrated, as dehydration can lead to fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exercise**: Given your advanced fitness level and preferred activities, try incorporating a mix of running and pilates into your routine. Running can help increase your cardiovascular endurance and energy levels, while pilates can improve your flexibility and core strength. Aim for a morning session on your available days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) to kickstart your day with energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sleep**: Ensure you're getting enough quality sleep each night. Aim for 7-9 hours and try to maintain a consistent sleep schedule. Consider creating a calming bedtime routine to help you wind down.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Stress Management**: High stress can drain your energy. Incorporate mindfulness practices such as meditation or deep-breathing exercises into your day. Even a short session can help recharge your mental energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Active Recovery**: On days when you feel particularly low on energy, consider lighter activities like gentle yoga or stretching to keep your body moving without overexerting yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, it's important to listen to your body and adjust your routine as needed. You're doing great, and with these adjustments, you should start to feel more energized! If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n",

      "4. **Connect with Others**: Talking to friends or family can provide support and help you feel less isolated. Sometimes just sharing your feelings can lighten the load.\n",

      "5. **Time Management**: Organizing your tasks and setting priorities can help you feel more in control and reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Healthy Eating**: A balanced diet can impact your mood and energy levels. Try to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Sleep Hygiene**: Ensure you’re getting enough quality sleep. Establish a calming bedtime routine and try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.\n",

      "8. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: Both can increase feelings of anxiety and disrupt your sleep, so it might be helpful to monitor your intake.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Bird-Dog**: From the same hands-and-knees position, extend one arm forward and the opposite leg back, keeping your back straight. Hold for a few seconds, then switch sides. This helps strengthen your core and lower back.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Child’s Pose**: Kneel on the floor, sit back on your heels, and stretch your arms forward on the ground. This pose gently stretches the back and can provide relief.\n",

      "\n",
      "Agent: Based on your wellness metrics from the last 7 days, here are some key insights:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Insights:\n",
      "1. **Mood Improvement**: Your latest mood score is 6.2/10, with an average of 6.1/10. This indicates a slight but positive trend in your mood, suggesting that you may be experiencing more positive emotions or coping better with challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Energy Levels**: Your energy levels have also shown improvement, with a latest score of 5.6/10 and an average of 5.3/10. This suggests that you may be feeling more energized and capable of engaging in daily activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sleep Quality**: Your sleep quality has improved significantly, with a latest score of 6.0/10 compared to an average of 5.5/10. Better sleep can contribute to both mood and energy levels, indicating that you may be getting more restorative rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Stress Levels**: While your stress level is at 6.7/10, which is slightly above average (6.8/10), it is showing a declining trend. This is a positive sign that you may be finding ways to manage stress more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Specific Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Continue Positive Habits**: Since your mood, energy, and sleep quality are improving, try to identify and continue any habits or activities that may be contributing to these positive changes. This could include regular exercise, mindfulness practices, or social interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Focus on Stress Management**: Although your stress levels are declining, they are still relatively high. Consider incorporating stress-reducing activities into your routine, such as yoga, meditation, or deep-breathing exercises. Setting aside time for relaxation can help further lower your stress levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene**: To maintain and improve your sleep quality, ensure you have a consistent sleep schedule, create a calming bedtime routine, and limit screen time before bed. This can help you achieve even better rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Encouragement for Positive Trends:\n",
      "It's wonderful to see that your mood, energy, and sleep quality are on the rise! These improvements indicate that you are making progress in your wellness journey. Keep up the great work, and remember that small, consistent changes can lead to significant benefits over time. Celebrate these positive trends and continue to nurture your well-being!\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Based on your wellness history from the last 7 days, here are some insights and recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Insights:\n",
      "1. **Mood Decline**: Your latest mood rating is 5.0/10, which is below your average of 6.0/10. This indicates a decline in your emotional well-being, which could be contributing to feelings of tiredness.\n",
      "2. **Stable Energy Levels**: Your energy level is currently at 7.0/10, which is above your average of 6.0/10. This suggests that while you may feel tired, your energy levels are relatively stable.\n",
      "3. **Consistent Sleep Quality**: Your sleep quality is rated at 7.0/10, matching your average. Good sleep quality is essential for overall wellness, but if you're still feeling tired, it may be worth examining other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Mood Boosting Activities**: Engage in activities that you enjoy or that typically lift your mood. This could include spending time with friends, practicing a hobby, or even light exercise, which can also help increase your energy levels.\n",
      "2. **Mindfulness and Relaxation**: Consider incorporating mindfulness practices such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. These can help improve your mood and reduce feelings of fatigue.\n",
      "3. **Physical Activity**: Even though your energy levels are stable, light physical activity can help enhance your mood and combat feelings of tiredness. A short walk or some gentle stretching might be beneficial.\n",
      "4. **Nutrition**: Ensure you are eating balanced meals with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Staying hydrated is also crucial, as dehydration can lead to fatigue.\n",
      "5. **Sleep Hygiene**: Since your sleep quality is stable, maintain good sleep hygiene by keeping a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and minimizing screen time before bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Encouragement:\n",
      "It's great to see that your energy levels and sleep quality are stable, which are positive indicators for your overall wellness. By addressing your mood and incorporating some of the recommendations above, you can work towards improving how you feel. Remember, it's okay to have ups and downs, and taking small steps can lead to significant improvements over time. Keep focusing on what makes you feel good!\n",

    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Wellness Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into assistants** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
